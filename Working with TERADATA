%Look at your raw data

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM strinfo

%The following statement would select the first 10 rows of the strinfo table,ordered in ascending alphabetical order by the city name (you would retrieve names that start with “a”):

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM strinfo
ORDER BY city ASC

%The following statement would select the first 10 rows of the strinfo table,ordered in descending alphabetical order by the city name (you would retrieve names that start with “w” and “y”):

SELECT TOP 10 * 
FROM strinfo
ORDER BY city DESC

%The following query would retrieve 10 random rows from the strinfo table:

SELECT * 
FROM strinfo
SAMPLE 10;

%The following query would retrieve a random 10% of the rows from the strinfo table:

SELECT *
FROM strinfo
SAMPLE .10

%Other important differences between Teradata and MySQL :
%DISTINCT and LIMIT can be used in the same query statement in MySQL, but DISTINCT and TOP cannot be used together in Teradata

%MySQL accepts either double or single quotation marks around strings of text in queries,but Teradata will only accept single quotation marks

MySQL will accept the symbols “!=” and “<>” to indicate “does not equal”, but Teradata will only accept “<>” (other operators, like “IN”, “BETWEEN”, and “LIKE” are the same: http://www.teradatawiki.net/2013/09/Teradata-Operators.html)
